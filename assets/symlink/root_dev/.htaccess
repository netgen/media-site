## Ibexa/Symfony ENVIRONMENT variables, for customizing index.php* execution
# * Only APP_ENV and APP_DEBUG supported by console command, rest are Ibexa DXP features in index.php.

# Environment.
# Possible values: "prod" and "dev" out-of-the-box, other values possible with proper configuration
# Defaults to "dev" if omitted (uses SetEnvIf so value can be used in rewrite rules)
SetEnvIf Request_URI ".*" APP_ENV=dev

# Optional: Whether to use debugging.
# Possible values: 0, 1 or ""
# Defaults to enabled if APP_ENV is set to "dev" if env value is omitted or empty
#if[APP_DEBUG] SetEnv APP_DEBUG "%APP_DEBUG%"

# Optional: Whether to use Symfony's builtin HTTP Caching Proxy.
# Disable it if you are using an external reverse proxy (e.g. Varnish)
# Possible values: 0, 1 or ""
# Defaults to disabled if APP_ENV is set to "dev" or TRUSTED_PROXIES is set,
# and if this env value is omitted or empty
#if[APP_HTTP_CACHE] SetEnv APP_HTTP_CACHE "%APP_HTTP_CACHE%"

# Optional: Defines the proxies to trust
# Needed when using Varnish as proxy, if so disable APP_HTTP_CACHE.
# Separate entries by a comma, example: "ip1,ip2"
# Defaults to not be set if env value is omitted or empty
#if[TRUSTED_PROXIES] SetEnv TRUSTED_PROXIES "%TRUSTED_PROXIES%"

# TIP: There are many more environment variables supported by Ibexa DXP. However unlike those listed above
#      they should in most cases rather be set in the environment then in vhost config to make sure cronjobs
#      and cli command usage takes them into account as well.
